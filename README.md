# Udemy-System-Verilog-2
Code I have written/modified for the Udemy course: SystemVerilog for Verification Part 2 : Projects

if the file name consists of the word "original", the code was not written by the student but was given by Sir Kumar Khandagle (lecturer of the course) for the student to modify the code based on the instruction given in the assignment.
The solution done (code modified) by the student would consists of the word "solution" in the filename. The solutions were tested on EDA playground before being uploaded onto GitHub.

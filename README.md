# Udemy-System-Verilog-2
Code I have written/modified for the Udemy course: SystemVerilog for Verification Part 2 : Projects

Some of the codefiles were not written from scratch by the student but was given by Sir Kumar Khandagle (lecturer of the course) for the student to modify the code based on the instruction given in the assignment.
The solutions were tested on EDA playground before being uploaded onto GitHub.

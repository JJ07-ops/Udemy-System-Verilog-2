Assignment agenda: Create a testbench environment for validating the SPI interface's ability to transmit data serially immediately when the CS signal goes low. Utilize the negative edge of the SCLK to sample the MOSI signal in order to generate reference data. Codes are added in Instruction tab.

Student's note: Testbench code was done by the student from scratch, with some reference to look on based on previous example given by the lecturer.
